# Frontal-Game

This is a WIP Game made using Godot 4, an FPS game that haven't really taken it shape yet

This project will most likely be non completed and this github purpose is to track progress, it will be open source and free until I finish the game *(or not)*

Upon the game release, this github may or may not be archived and project would or would be free to play (depending on my financial situation)

# Program Used

1> **Godot** - A free, open source game engine that i used to develop this game (Version 4.1.2)

2> **Blender** - A free, open source 3D softeare that allow me to make 3D models for the game

3> **Substance Painter 3D** - A paid software by Adobe that allow me to texture all my model in seamless *(yet buggy)* workflow with Blender

4> **Visual Studio Code** - A free open source text editor that is sometimes used to be a external editor for GDScript.
